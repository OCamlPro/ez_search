 (name ez_search)
 (synopsis "The ez_search library")
 (description "ez_search is a library for indexing files and searching content with rexgexps.\nIt creates a dababase of two files (one with the raw files, one with the \nindex) on disk. \nThe database can then be searched for occurrences of regexps, using\neither [Re] or [Str]. Direct string matching and case insensitive searches \nare also supported.\nEz_search can [mmap] the database to decrease its memory footprint, and\n[Parmap] to search the database on multiple cores in parallel (in which case\nthe results may overlap).\nIt also provides a \"context extraction\" feature to display lines above and \nafter an occurrence.\n")
